# Metrobus Web

Simple web application to tell you how long it is until
the next bus on given route leaving from a given bus stop
going a given direction.  The bulk of the logic is contained in a gem which
can be found here: https://github.com/sbower/metrobus.

The running application can be accessed here: http://metrobus.hmicwptpne.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/
